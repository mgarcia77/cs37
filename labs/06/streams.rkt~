          (else
           (scons (car lst)

          (else (scons (scar s1)

;; Here are some infinite streams:

(define whole (scons 0 (smap add1 whole)))

;; These are two "obvious" streams which we can derive from whole:

(define positives (scdr whole))
(define negatives (smap - positives))

;; EXERCISE 0
;;
;; Can you figure out the values stored in the following infinite
;; stream without running it?
;;
;; (define mystery (scons 1 (add-streams mystery mystery)))


;; EXERCISE 1 
;;
;; How can we define the integers (-inf, inf)?  We could try
;; sappend'ing all the negatives onto all the positives as follows:
;;
(define integers-first-attempt (sappend negatives positives))
;;
;; a. Why doesn't this work?
;;

;; b. To fix this, we need a strategy of which takes from the first
;; stream, then the second stream, then the first stream, then the
;; second, etc.  This is usually called "zip" because it zips up two
;; lists the way a zipper works. (In Python and Haskell, there is a
;; built-in procedure called "zip", though it's behavior is slightly
;; different than described here.)  If you exhaust one stream, the
;; procedure ends.  For example, zip on two lists (not streams) might
;; look like this: (zip '(1 2 3) '(4 5)) -> (1 4 2 5))
;;
;; Write the stream version "szip" then demonstrate that your answer
;; is correct. 

(define szip
  (lambda (s1 s2)
    '...))
  
(define integers (szip whole negatives))


;; Using smap and szip, we can create a stream which includes all the
;; multiples of 2 and the multiples of 3:

(define multiples-of-2 
  (smap (lambda (x) (* 2 x)) positives))

(define multiples-of-3
  (smap (lambda (x) (* 3 x)) positives))

(define multiples-of-2-and-3
  (szip multiples-of-2 multiples-of-3))

;; c. Are there any problems with the definition of
;; multiples-of-2-and-3 above?


;; EXERCISE 2
;;
;; What if, instead of szipping two streams, we wanted two streams to
;; be sorted as they were merged?  What if we wanted this sorted
;; stream to contain no duplicates? (Hint: The solution is in the text
;; if you get stuck, but try and solve it on your own).  This solution
;; assumes both streams are already sorted from smallest to largest.
;; This is true for the multiples-of-2 and multiples-of-3 streams
;; listed above.

(define smerge
  (lambda (s1 s2)
    '...))

(define smerged-multiples-of-2-and-3
  (smerge multiples-of-2 multiples-of-3))

;; Demonstrate that your answer is correct.


;; EXERCISE 3
;;
;; What if we wanted to compute the intersection of two streams
;; (assuming both streams are already sorted and have no duplicates)?

(define sintersect
  (lambda (s1 s2)
    '...))
    
(define multiples-of-6
  (sintersect multiples-of-2 multiples-of-3))

;; Demonstrate that your answer is correct.


;; EXERCISE 4
;;
;; We can do some other interesting things with streams.  For example,
;; we can generate a stream of random numbers:
;;
(define random-stream
  (lambda (n)
    (scons (random n) (random-stream n))))

(define rands (random-stream 100))
;;
;; a. Describe the output of (sfirst rands 10)
;;
;; b. What do you expect you would get if you 
;; evaluated run (sfirst rands 10) a second time
;; immediately after evaluating it the first time?
;;

;; Note: On Thursday in class, we will look at more efficient ways to
;; store streams so that values in the stream are cached once they are
;; examined.  You may want to come back to this question once you've
;; updated your stream to see how the result you get in 4(b) is
;; different, if at all.


;; EXERCISE 5
;; We can also do some other interesting things, such as generate a
;; stream with alternating true and false values:

(define alternating-booleans
  (scons #t (smap not alternating-booleans)))

;; a. Write the procedure stream-select which takes two streams,
;; input-stream and boolean-stream, and as output, produces a new
;; stream with the following property: position j in the input-stream
;; is included in the output-stream if position j in the
;; boolean-stream is true.
;;
;; For example, if we used positives as the input-stream and
;; alternating-booleans as the boolean-stream, we would get the odd
;; numbers as the output-stream.

(define stream-select
  (lambda (input-stream boolean-stream)
    '...))

;(stream-select positives alternating-booleans) ; => odd positives

;; b. Before you run it, can you figure out what this does:

;(stream-select positives 
;               (stream-select alternating-booleans
;                              alternating-booleans))

;; c. What about this?

;(stream-select positives 
;               (stream-select alternating-booleans
;                              (scdr alternating-booleans)))




;; EXERCISE 6

;; In class we wrote sfilter, which takes a predicate, pred?, and a
;; stream, s, and creates a new stream whose values are only those
;; values of the stream, s, which *satisfy* the predicate:

(define sfilter 
  (lambda (pred? s) 
    (cond ((snull? s) snull) 
          ((pred? (scar s)) (scons (scar s) (sfilter pred? (scdr s)))) 
          (else  
           (sfilter pred? (scdr s)))))) 
 
;; Write a procedure called sfilter-out which creates a new stream
;; whose values are only those values of the stream, s, which *do not
;; satisfy* the predicate, pred?
(define sfilter-out
  (lambda (pred? s)
    '...))


;; EXERCISE 7

;; There's not much to do in this exercise except see couple of fun
;; examples, so just play along...

;; Sometimes streams are "divergent streams".
;; For example:
;;
;; First, compute the even positive numbers

(define even (sfilter even? positives))

;; Next, sfilter the stream, keeping only the odds.

;; (define odd (sfilter odd? even))
;;
;; 7a. Without running the above line, describe the stream "odd"
;; below:


;; 7b. What's in the stream we get by intersecting the negatives and
;; the positives?
;;
;; (define intersection (intersect negatives positives))


;; EXERCISE 8

;; In Section 3.5.3, there's a discussion of "infinite streams of pairs"
;; http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-24.html#%_sec_Temp_476

;; The text defines a procedure called 'pairs' which uses the 'szip' procedure
;; you wrote in Exercise 1. (The text calls the szip procedure 'interleave'.)
;; If you 'szip' procedure doesn't work, you won't be able to complete this question.
 

(define pairs
  (lambda (s1 s2)
    (scons
     (list (scar s1) (scar s2))
     (szip
      (smap (lambda (x) (list (scar s1) x))
            (scdr s2))
      (pairs (scdr s1) (scdr s2))))))
  
;; (define pos-pos (pairs positives positives))

;; (Adapted from Ex. 3.66 in the textbook) Examine the stream pos-pos
;; above. Can you make any general comments about the order in which
;; the pairs are placed into the stream? For example, about how many
;; pairs precede the pair (1,100)? the pair (99,100)? the pair
;; (100,100)?  This question is about thinking how the list of pairs
;; is constructed.  You don't need to get hung up on a mathematical
;; definition of the order of the pairs, though you are welcome to do so!
