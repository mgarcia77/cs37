Introduction
------------

We begin by representing a point as a list of an x coordinate and a y
coordinate, and we will represent a line segment as a list of a start
point and an end point.

On this abstraction of points and segments, we will create other
abstractions such as polygons.  We will be able to display and animate
the figures we create.

In order to do graphics in Racket, you must include 
(require graphics/graphics) at the top of your file as is done here.

In order to draw, we will create a 500 x 500 canvas: the center of
this canvas is the point (0,0), so the valid range of x and y
coordinates is from -250 to 250.

You are given the following graphics functions:

(start-graphics): opens the graphics window with a blank canvas
(end-graphics): closes the graphics window
(draw-segment segment): draws a line segment in the graphics window
(erase-segment segment): erases a line segment from the graphics window


Implementation
--------------
All of the code for the graphics functions described above can be
found in the file graphics.rkt which is provided. 

Exercise 1a: 

Execute the graphics.rkt file in Racket and then try the following:

(define vertical-line 
  (make-segment
   (make-point 0 -250)
   (make-point 0 0)))

(define horizontal-line
  (make-segment
   (make-point -250 150)
   (make-point 250 150)))

(start-graphics)
(draw-segment vertical-line)
(draw-segment horizontal-line)

You should see a vertical line (centered left-right in the window)
which starts at the bottom and ends in the center, and a horizontal
line (above the center of the window) which goes from the left side to
the right side.  Change the coordinates of the horizontal line so that
it ends halfway across the screen.

Exercise 1b:

To be sure that you understand the coordinate system, draw a square
that has its lower left corner at the point (0,0) and each side has
length 100.

Complete the remaining exercises described in the graphics.rkt file.
